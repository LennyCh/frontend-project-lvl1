This file contains a description of five games:
1) Determination of an even number - "brain-even";
2) Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated - "brain-calc";
3) Determination of the greatest common factor - "brain-gcf";
4) Progression. Search for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers - "brain-progression";
5) Definition of a prime number.

You need to answer correctly three questions in a row. If you do not answer one of the questions, the game will end. But you can run it again. 
Below you will see a more detailed description of each of these games, and how to run them.

1) Brain-even.

You are shown a random number. And you need to answer "yes" if the number is even, or "no" if it is odd.

To run this game enter "make brain-even" from root directory (~programms/frontend-project-lvl1).

2) Brain-calc.

You are shown a random mathematical expression (addition, subtraction or multiplication). You need to calculate it and write the correct answer. 

To run this game enter "make brain-calc" from root directory (~programms/frontend-project-lvl1).

3) Brain-gcf.

You are shown two random numbers. You must calculate and enter the largest common divisor of these numbers.

To run this game enter "make brain-gcf" from root directory (~programms/frontend-project-lvl1).

4) Brain-progression.

You are shown 10 numbers forming an arithmetic progression. One of the numbers in this progression is missing. You must determine this number.

To run this game enter "make brain-progression" from root directory (~programms/frontend-project-lvl1).

5) Brain-prime.

You are shown a random number. And you need to answer "yes" if the number is prime, otherwise answer "no".

To run this game enter "make brain-prime" from root directory (~programms/frontend-project-lvl1).
